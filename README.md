This is a simple platformer game built with Pygame. The player can move left, right and jump to reach the end of the level.

To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 and Pygame installed on your computer. You can install Pygame by running pip install pygame in your terminal.

The game consists of four Python files:

main.py: This is the main file that you will run to start the game. It sets up the Pygame environment and initializes the game loop.

level.py: This file defines the Level class, which sets up the game level and manages collisions between the player and the environment.

player.py: This file defines the Player class, which controls the player's movement and animation.

tiles.py: This file defines the Tile class, which represents the individual tiles in the game level.

The settings.py file contains various game settings such as the size of the screen, the size of the tiles, and the layout of the game level.

To start the game, run main.py. The player can move left and right using the arrow keys, and jump using the spacebar. The objective is to reach the end of the level without falling off the screen.
